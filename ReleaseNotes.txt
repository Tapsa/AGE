[b]Notes[/b]

[color=red]Make your own backups![/color]
Extract to anywhere and run.
You may need to run the program as administrator.
No help files are included.
No mod affects your already saved games, only new games.
You may be able to undo changes by going back to the text box and pressing Ctrl + Z.

[b]Tips[/b]

[color=blue]Oncoming versions will have more popup tooltips![/color]
You can have multiple search entries separated with "|" letter. Upper search boxes are inclusive and lower ones exclusive.
Example: "tower|ship|ram"
You can switch from [i]or[/i] finding to [i]and[/i] finding with check boxes. Meaning that every search entry has to match.
