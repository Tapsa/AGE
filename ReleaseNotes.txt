[b]Tips[/b]

[color=blue]Oncoming versions will have more popup tooltips![/color]
You can have multiple search entries separated with "|" letter. Upper search boxes are inclusive and lower ones exclusive.
Example: "tower|ship|ram"
You can switch from [i]or[/i] finding to [i]and[/i] finding with check boxes. Meaning that every search entry has to match.
